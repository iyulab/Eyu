## Unreleased

## 0.1.0

First published version. What it contains is what the README describes; the
short form:

### Added

- `Eyu.Core` — the judgment contract: `IStructureSource`, `IRecordSample`,
  `IOntologyProposer`, `IGroundingContract`, `IModelClient`, with a single-pass
  reference proposer (`SinglePassOntologyProposer`) over an OpenAI-compatible
  chat-completions client (`HttpModelClient`).
- Grounded proposals: every entity and relation carries the record ids it was
  drawn from, and a response citing a record the call never supplied is refused
  rather than returned.
- Declared structure: a caller's declaration is authoritative — declared types
  are stamped `ProposalBasis.Declared`, and a relation proposed under a declared
  name whose ends contradict the declaration is dropped. The prompt asks the
  model to treat a declaration as a floor, not a ceiling.
- Entity resolution inside the proposal: a Fellegi-Sunter pre-filter (EM-fitted
  per batch, with a heuristic fallback for small batches) pre-links confirmed
  matches, hands gray-zone pairs to the model, and folds the prior into each
  claim's confidence. Opt-in Jaro-Winkler field comparison for notation
  variants.
- Confidence routing: `RoutingPolicy` with per-origin (`Innate` / `Acquired`)
  thresholds; Eyu proposes and never applies.
- Clerical review support for measuring entity-resolution accuracy without a
  labelled set: stratified sampling, record-level scoring, agreement statistics,
  Rao-Wu bootstrap intervals and a capped Neyman allocation
  (`docs/clerical-review.md`).
- `Eyu.Formbase` — `IStructureSource` and `IRecordSample` adapters over
  Formbase form declarations and rows.
- Quality instruments in the test project: competency-question reach, a
  declared-completeness ablation ladder with Spearman correlation, and a live
  measurement suite that runs only when an endpoint is configured.
